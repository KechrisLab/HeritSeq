Description: This package provides a statistical framework to analyze 
    heritability of gene expression based on next-generation sequencing 
    data and simulating sequencing reads. Variance partition coefficients 
    (VPC) are computed using linear mixed effects and generalized linear 
    mixed effects models. Compound Poisson and negative binomial models 
    are included.
